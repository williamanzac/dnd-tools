# Backgrounds
acolyte.name=Acolyte
acolyte.description=You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.<br />Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in appendix B or those specified by your DM, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.
acolyte.skills.description=Insight, Religion
acolyte.languages.description=Two of your choice
acolyte.characteristics.description=Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

dwarf.age.description=Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.
dwarf.alignment.description=Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.
dwarf.size.description=Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
dwarf.speed.description=Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armour.
dwarf.darkvision.description=Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.
dwarvenresilience.description=You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).
dwarvencombattraining.description=You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and warhammer.
dwarventoolproficiency.description=You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.
stonecunning.description=Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
dwarf.knownlanguages.description=You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

hilldwarf.description=As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.
hilldwarf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Constitution score increases by 2. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
dwarventoughness.description=Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

mountaindwarf.description=As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You're probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter colouration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
mountaindwarf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Constitution score increases by 2. Your Strength score increases by 2.
dwarvenarmortraining.description=You have proficiency with light and medium armour.

elf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
elf.age.description=Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
elf.alignment.description=Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
elf.size.description=Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
elf.speed.description=Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
elf.darkvision.description=Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.
elf.keensenses.description=You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
elf.feyancestry.description=You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
elf.trance.description=Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
elf.knownlanguages.description=You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
elfweapontraining.description=You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

highelf.description=As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. <br />The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.
highelf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
highelf.cantrip.description=You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
highelf.extralanguage.description=You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

woodelf.description=As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves. Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-coloured. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.
woodelf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
woodelf.fleetoffoot.description=Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.
woodelf.maskofthewild.description=You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

drow.description=Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves. <br />Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.
drow.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Your Charisma score increases by 1.
drow.superiordarkvision.desctiption=Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.
sunlightsensitivity.description=You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
drowmagic.description=You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
drowweapontraining.description=You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.

halfelf.abilitymodifiers.description=Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
halfelf.age.description=Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.
halfelf.alignment.description=Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.
halfelf.knownlanguages.description=You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.
halfelf.darkvision.description=Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.
halfelf.height.description=Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall.
halfelf.size.description=Your size is Medium.
halfelf.speed.description=Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
halfelf.feyancestry.description=You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
halfelf.skillversatility.description=You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
