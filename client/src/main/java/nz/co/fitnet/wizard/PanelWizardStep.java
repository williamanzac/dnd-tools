/**
 * This is a base class for JPanel based wizard steps. Subclasses override the methods {@link #init}, {@link #prepare},
 * {@link #applyState}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Wizard} listens to property change events from the step and will update accordingly when ever
 * {@link #setComplete} or {@link #setBusy} is called.
 * <p>
 * An example is shown below.
